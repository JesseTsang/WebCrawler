# WebCrawler
My 2nd python project. It's a webcrawler.

This webcrawler will basically go through all the pages in your website and produce a report of all the links. 
The result can be used as either as a sitemap or as a basis for a custom search engine. 
Building on top of that, we can further gather a lot of useful statistics on each pages.
